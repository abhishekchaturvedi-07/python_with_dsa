## Features

- **Python Basics**: Learn the fundamentals of Python, including variables, data types, loops, functions, and more.
- **Data Structures**: Understand and implement various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- **Algorithms**: Master key algorithms including sorting algorithms (like bubble sort and merge sort) and searching algorithms (like binary search).
- **Hands-on Examples**: Each topic is accompanied by practical examples and exercises to reinforce learning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekchaturvedi-07/python_with_dsa
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Python-Basics-DSA
    ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., `basics/`, `data_structures/`, or `algorithms/`) and run the Python scripts to learn and test the concepts.

Example:
```sh
cd basics
python 01_hello_world.py
