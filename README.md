    5. Commands for Data Cleaning
        Here are some essential commands and techniques for data cleaning using pandas:
        
        Handling Missing Data:
        
        df.dropna(): Drop rows with missing values.
        df.fillna(value): Fill missing values with specified value.
        Data Transformation:
        
        df.apply(func): Apply a function along an axis.
        df.replace(old, new): Replace values in DataFrame.
        Removing Duplicates:
        
        df.drop_duplicates(): Remove duplicate rows from DataFrame.
        String Manipulation:
        
        df.str.lower(), df.str.upper(): Convert strings to lowercase or uppercase.
        Data Filtering:
        
        df[df['column'] > value]: Filter rows based on condition.
